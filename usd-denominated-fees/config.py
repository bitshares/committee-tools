# Shareholder Summary
# ===================
#
# Thanks to some keen external developers we are soon to see what is referred to as BSIP#10
# and will allow percentage based transfer fees and give the BitShares ecosystem some needed
# flexibility to distinguish between different cultures. Another idea that came up recently,
# was the limitation of transfers by rate and offering it for free to get an unfair
# advantage over other crypto currencies and ecosystem while still having ways to monetize
# by other operations, such as trading. However, the development is quite intensive and will
# take some more weeks to complete.
#
# To resolve the highly discussed fee issue of many shareholders, the BitShares community
# and most of the existing businesses, the committee has decided to step up and act now with
# the option for modifications once BSIP#10 is available.
#
# After several days of intensive discussion, we've constructed a whole new fee schedule for
# the BitShares ecosystem that has **drastically reduces** the fees required for the **core
# features**, namely, *transfers* and *trading*, but increases the fees of more specialized
# operations. By this, we keep the referral program attractive and can attract more
# customers as we become more competitive with other service providers for these features,
# but have them at one place.
#
# Even though this fee schedule has had a lot of thoughts, we we will have more options once
# BSIP#10 or the rate-limited free transfer is available to be implemented for bitassets
# owned by the committee. In the mean time, however, we would like to give everyone the
# opportunity to make use of a low flat fee for all transfers with in the network and have
# decided to ask for $0.018 (less than 6 BTS at current valuation) per transfer! Keep in
# mind that this will be a **limited-time offer** and the minimum fee may be raised once
# BSIP#10 is implemented.
#
# We would further like to encourage traders and market makers to provide liquidity by
# asking for only $0.001 per created order (with 90% refund on cancelation if unfilled) and
# a low 0.10% trading fee for committee owned assets such as bitUSD, etc.
#
# In this proposal, the referral program will receive most of its funds by more advanced
# operations, such as *proposals*, *withdraw permissions* as well as *account upgrades*. The
# committee will keep the option to change old (non basic) features and implement new
# features for **LTM-only** for a period of time and offer it to basic members only later.
# This way, we effectivley, upgrade memberships into premium products.
#
# Additionally, going forward with this fee schedule, we will track the **USD denomination**
# of fees and thus update the schedule if the valuation of BTS changes.
#
# Roadmap
# =======
#
# As Soon As Possible
# -------------------
#
# * change the flat fee strucutre to incorporate customer feedback
#   and improve competitiveness and liquidity.
# * start implementation of BSIP#10 (if approved)
# * start discussions about
#   * requiring LTM-ship for specific operations (e.g. asset_create)
#   * removing of specific operations from Referral program (e.g. account_upgrade)
# * start Implementation for distiction of bitasset fees from prediction
#   market fees
# * start Implemenation of methods to improve liquidity
#   * either on protocol level (MAKER, DAC as bitasset provider, ...)
#   * improving trading experience (GUI, API)
# * elaborate the implementation details and consequences of rate-limited but free
#   transfers throughout the network
#
# As soon as BSIP#10 is approved and ready
# ----------------------------------------
#
# * upgrade protocol (hard fork) to include BSIP#10
# * modify committee owned assets to ask for percentage transfer fees
# * start discussion about possible protocol modifications:
#   * protocol upgrade to distinguish fees for bitassets and prediction markets
#   * add committee controlled flags to prevent/allow specific operations
#     to be used by basic members but allowed for premium members (LTM)
#   * add committee controlled flags to include/exclude specific
#     operations from the referral program
#   * add period-dependent fee for withdraw_permission_claim
#
# 6 months after the last fee schedule change
# -------------------------------------------
#
# * obtain input and feedback from businesses taking part in the referral program
# * optional minor modifications to the fee schedule
#
# Periodically every 12 months after the last change of the fee schedule
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# * re-evaluate revenue of referral program and improve fee schedule given
#   feedback of corresponding businesses and more statistics
# * evaluation of revenue and costs of the DAC and the referral program.
# * optional changes to the fee schedule
#
# Overview
# ========
#
# Rational for changes to the flat fees now
#
# 1. The transfer of value (any token) is a core functionality of many crypto
#    currencies and business like dwolla and paypal. In order to be competitive,
#    we need a lower over all cost associated with that operation/transaction.
#    Furthermore, the costs associated with that operation are rather low because
#    only account ids, asset ids and an amount are involved. Optional memos can be
#    set a higher fee. The transfer operation is considered a *core* functionality
#    of BitShares and its used should be incentivized. This way, we can
#    even attract more businesses that are looking for micropayment
#    solutions.
#
# 2. Another *core* functionality and major *value proposition* is the
#    decentralized exchange (DEX) which is associated with a different set of feed.
#    Currently, the fees are flat fees for order creation, cancellation and update,
#    and are independent of the amount actually traded. Hence, small volume orders
#    pay the same fee as large volume orders. Taking a closer look at any
#    competitor reveals that this should certainly chance. Instead of asking for a
#    rather high flat fee to compensate the costs of the DEX (storing and matching
#    orders), I here propose to reduce the flat fee drastically to an amount that
#    mostly to prevents spam and instead set a percentage trading fee for every
#    committee-owned asset. The advantages are that the committee (read: DAC) could
#    earn more fees from matching orders. Since cancellation of orders results in a
#    refund of the creation fee, this should also encourage traders to bring
#    liquidity. A disadvantage is that the DAC earns less from trading of assets
#    that are not owned by the committee, such as OPEN.BTC, TRADE.MUSE etc. because
#    the flat fees are reduced and the percentage market fees go to the
#    corresponding issuer. Anyway, this approach should result in more traders
#    using the DEX and an increase of liquidity.
#
#    What percentage should be used? Since we are using a fixed percentage
#    independent of an individuals volume, we should choose a percentage that is
#    lower than the highest fee asked for by big exchanges such as Kraken,
#    Coinbase, BTC38, etc. Furthermore, regional difference should be
#    taken into account eventually. For now I propose a fee of
#
#                            0.10%
#
#    of the matched volume which is less than most centralized competitors even
#    though we offer an increased security over them. This fee may be considered as
#    a welcome package and may probably be increased to something close to 0.5% to
#    reflect the decentralized and trust-free nature of the DEX.
#
# 3. Now that we have reduced the fees for our two core functionalities, how can we
#    rescue the referral program that pays the registrar/affiliate a fraction of
#    the payed fee from referrers? The transfer and trading fees certainly don't
#    motive business to bring in more users if they don't get paid!
#
#    The solution is rather simple: The above mentioned transfer and trade
#    operations are only two out of many operations that can be used by customers
#    to make full use of BitShares. There is also the creation of assets,
#    withdrawal permissions as well as worker, committee member creation and
#    proposals. These fees can be used to let the referral program benefit from
#    customers.
#
#    So, we distinguish power users from regular users. Power users should be
#    encouraged to upgrade their account to a life-time membership (or annual
#    membership) to reduce their fees by 80% (receive cashback). The regular users
#    rarely creates new assets and uses it frequently, as well as use more advanced
#    features of the network, but if he does, we can ask for a comparably high fee
#    since there are only few competitors with these functionalities, if at all.
#    A power users that wants to see constantly reduced fees and benefit from
#    cheaper advanced features should be asked to pay a higher fee to upgrade his
#    account.
#
# In short: The referral program should only receive minor benefit from the core
# value proposition (transfers and trades) of the DEX but instead make
# its profit from the advanced features of the network, such as:
#
# * memberships for reduced fees
# * individual assets
# * withdrawal permissions
# * proposals
# * prediction market
# * among others
#
# Important factors:
# ------------------
#
# - All flat fees here are basic member fees. For LTM, most fees get cur
#   by 80%
#
# - The flat fees below are denoted in USD even though the network asks for fees
#   in BTS. This means that the BTS fees have to be adjusted from time to time
#   to follow BTS' volatility. This can be achieved by scripting easily.
#
# - In order to show stability to investors, businesses, and customers, the flat
#   USD denoted fees should not be changed for an interval of AT LEAST 6 months.
#   Hence, we should find a consensus for a USD-denoted fee schedule and
#   stick with it.
#
# - All fees in this document are proposals, ands thus not final. They further
#   require committee's approval.
#
# - Shall this proposal be accepted, it will revise the 3x transfer
#   price vision for STEALTH transfers to a 7x factor to let the
#   investor(s) reach their ROI as has been initially promised.
#
# - It makes sense to incorporate the opinions and requirements of businesses
#   running on top of BitShares as far as possible. We need them! Hence, we should
#   talk to:
#
#   * OpenLedger
#   * metaexchange
#   * bitcash
#   * transwiser
#   * freebie
#   * bunkerchainlabs
#   * peermit
#   * blocktrades.us
#   * BitShares POS
#   * OnceUponATime (STEALTH)
#
#   Centralized exchanges are not part of this list since they mainly benefit from
#   reduced transfer fees and don't run a business *whithin* BitShares (i.e. no
#   referral program, no use of special blockchain capabilities)
#
# Conclusion:
# ===========
#
# The proposal above as well as the flat fees below try to find a balance
# between cheaper transfers and improving the liquidity of the DEX while still
# having marketers benefit from the referral program. This is achieved by
# reducing the flat fees of the core transfer and trading operations, adding a
# percentage market fee and increasing the fees associated with operations that
# are special to BitShares alone and have only fee competitors. In order to
# attract people to the DEX, we need to be competing with centralized exchanges
# in terms of fees in the beginning and once people realize the power of
# decentralized trading, the fees could potentially be raised slightly.
#
# High Level Overview of changes:
# -------------------------------
#
# The scripts used to track the USD fee are [publicly
# auditable](https://github.com/BitShares-Committee/Instructions/tree/master/usd-denominated-fees).
# A detailed descriptipon about every single operation and it's associated
# fee is available under
# [github](https://github.com/BitShares-Committee/Instructions/blob/master/usd-denominated-fees/fee-schedule-proposed-by-xeroc.py).
#
# ### Fee Types:
#
# * `fee` is a flat price that has to be paid per operation
# * `price_per_kbyte` is a fee that has to be paid per kilobyte of transaction size
#   (i.e. longer memos cost more than shorter memos)
# * `account_create` distinguishes `premium_fee` names (expensive) from `basic_fee`
#   names (cheap)
# * `account_upgrade` distinguishes between a annual subscription and a life time
#   subscription
# * `asset_create` distinguishes between the number of characters of the symbol (i.e.
#   short symbols are very expensive, longer ones are cheap)
# * blind transfers have to pay per output.

    #     Transfer of any asset that use the flat fee model pay
    #     this fee.
    #
    # Rational:
    #
    #     * Transactions are stored indefinitely on the blockchain
    #     * Most competitors have a fee of about $1c
    #     * Transfers are a core product of BTS
    #       Most people in crypto space use crypto tokens mostly to
    #       transfer value and they are not interested in other
    #       features.
    #     * Businesses based on the Referral program depend on
    #       income from their customers operations
    #     * Too high fee is hinders user-adoption
    #
    # Current Stats:
    #
    #     * 150-200 transfers per day
    #     * current fee: 30 BTS
    #     * makes: 4500-6000 BTS per day
    #     * that makes 3600-4800 BTS per day per user for the
    #       referral program
    #     * in dollars, this is 14.40-19.20 USD per user
    #
    # Compared to Bitcoin:
    #
    #     * BitShares is capable to run way more transactions than Bitcoin
    #     * 220.000 transactions/transfers per day
    #     * result in 19k USD transaction fees (payed to miners)
    #
    #     Assuming 220k transfers per day on bitshares:
    #     * 220000 * 30BTS * 0.004 USD/BTS = 26k USD
    #
    # Conclusion:
    #
    #     * At BTC load, BTS income from transfers would be 40% above BTC's
    #     * Thus, fees can be reduced by 40% to compete with BTC
    #     * Reducing by another 40% to incentivized people to use BTS instead of BTC
    #     * Proposed transfer fee:
    #           30 * (1-80%) = 6 BTS (approx $1.8c-$2.0c)
    #     * Let Referral program businesses make more profit from
    #       other features that are considered less 'core'-ish
    #     * price_per_kbyte relatively high in order to:
    #          * prevent people from storing raw data in transfers and thus the blockchain
    #          * still allow long memos:
    #               1 char  =  1 byte
    #              32 chars = 32 bytes (should be sufficient to cover most use cases)
    #              32 bytes / 1024 bytes per kbyte * 0.01 = 0.0031 USD = $0.31c (extra for the memo)

    #     decentralized exchange.
    #
    # Rational:
    #
    #     * these represent a core feature of BitShares
    #     * a fee set to high will hinder market makers and thus liquidity
    #     * with less liquidity we cannot attract users
    #     * a fee that is too low has two issues:
    #         * open up a spam attack vector
    #         * does more harm than good to the blockchain
    #     * a compromise has to be found
    #     * in contrast to other exchanges:
    #          * if an order is not matched, only the cancellation
    #            fee will be applied and the creation fee will be
    #            refunded
    #          * depending on the asset, there is no percentage
    #            market fee, but a flat fee
    #
    # Other exchanges:
    #
    #     * percentage trading fee 0.1%-0.25% fee on market orders
    #       (maker/taker)
    #     * no flat fees for orders
    #     * Assuming a daily volume of 2,500,000 $ (Kraken) this
    #       makes them an income of 6,500 USD daily
    #     * no status about number of trades are available
    #     * Assuming an average trade amount of $500, we get 25k
    #       trades
    #
    #     Assuming 25k orders per day in bitshares:
    #     * 25k * 10 BTS * 0.004 USD/BTS = 1000 USD per day (only from
    #       flat fees, independent of whether the trade has been filled or
    #       not)
    #     * Currently 0% trading fee on most bitAssets (committee-owned)
    #
    # Conclusion
    #
    #     * The dex is VERY cheap already considering only filled orders
    #     * Since cancellation is almost for free, liquidity
    #       providers shouldn't worry at all
    #     * Having a trading fee that is higher than transfer makes
    #       no sense and people would stick with trading on external
    #       exchanges
    #     * As we cannot distinguish maker from taker yet (MAKER
    #       proposal), we charge a flat fee for the operations, which
    #       hurts market makers and liquidity providers as they pre-pay
    #       the fees even if their orders are not filled.
    #     * Instead of benefiting from the flat fees, we should encourage
    #       liquidity providers by very low flat fees and raise the
    #       percentage trading fee for all committee-owned assets (as
    #       described in the introduction).
    #     * Regional differences can be made to distinguish CNY from USD,
    #       GOLD and EUR.
    #     * I thus propose a $0.001c flat fee and rising the percentage
    #       trading fee to 0.10% per filled trade.

    #
    # Rational:
    #
    #     * Assets are created rarely in general
    #     * Assets, even though they seem to be a core product of
    #       BitShares, the creation of them is not a core operation
    #     * Creating an asset is a one-time fee
    #     * Depending on whether the shareholders would like to see

    #       shouldn't be too cheap.
    #     * Businesses that refer others to BitShares that are

    #
    # Conclusion
    #
    #     * Premium symbols should be considered very expensive and

    # Conclusion:

    #     * We can set anything over here, it doesn't really matter.
    #     * Since Committee is now tracking the fee in USD, we should have this
    #       fee quite low, otherwise, committee will pay funds that belong to the
    #       business, to the reserver pool, that belongs to the business (read:

    # Description:
    #
    #     Withdraw permission are used for the recurring payments
    #     program. This op allows someone else to withdraw funds up
    #     to a limit from your account.
    #
    # Rational:
    #
    #     * Given that this feature can be used for scheduled
    #       payments, it should be considered a core feature
    #     * Since competitors (banks) allow withdrawals for almost
    #       free the fee should be rather high.
    #     * Given that you can here define an upper limit for
    #       withdrawals, the extra functionality should be paid by the
    #       user.
    #     * Use cases for rare transactions of this type
    #            * pay rent
    #            * allow credit card withdrawals
    #            * mobile phone carriers ..
    #            * etc.
    #     * Use cases for more frequent transactions of this type:

    #            * multimedia/video on demand subscriptions
    #            * etc.
    #     * withdraw permissions are assumed to be rather
    #       frequent given the many types of subscriptions
    #
    # Conclusion:
    #
    #     * Given that this feature adds more functionality to your
    #       account than a regular bank account, we can ask for a
    #       little fee here. Anything from $0.10 to $5 might be
    #       considered fair.

    # Description:
    #
    #     Withdraw permissions do not automatically transfer funds.
    #     Instead, they need to be claimed by the to-be-paid party.
    #
    # Rational:
    #
    #     * This operation might appear one every day/week/month for
    #       every withdrawal permission, hence it is assumed to be
    #       used frequently.
    #     * The payee will probably forward any costs to the payer
    #       thus discourage the use of withdrawal permissions.
    #     * This operation is only added to the blockchain if
    #       there is a valid "withdraw_permission" from that
    #       account
    #     * Subscriptions amounts may differ from business to
    #       business
    #     * Every business can decide how often to pay this
    #       fee and we need to encourage them to reduce the
    #       frequency.

    #       operate balances off-chain (e.g. monthly bills
    #       for many off-chain microtransactions)
    #
    # Conclusion:

    #       compromise between
